## The Translation Problem

Translations have all been a problem while developing Seconds. Runloop is a small team and to keep translations affordable we have tried a variety of methods, each have their pros but are mostly outweighed by their cons.

The most important factors for us are:
- The time it takes to find quality translators that know the topic of interval training
- the time it takes to have translations returned to us
- the cost

The options we have available to us are freelances, translation companies and computed translations.

Freelancers have the benefit of being cheaper but with the disadvantages of the time required to find and manange them, plus the time it takes to get translations back. These delays can hold up time sensitive app updates.

Translation companies typically get the translations back within a few days, but at a much greater cost.

The quality of the translations provided by either of the above has not great. The reason for this is likely that the context of the translation is not always clear when working through the list of text that the app contains.

As such, more recently we have simply reverted to using Google Translate. The benefits of speed and cost are hard to argue with. Translations are delivered in seconds, and cost next to nothing. The quality of the translation is adaquate, bordering on poor. 

## Community

Moving forward we are going to continue to provide computed translations with the app. However, we have provided this public repository to enable users of Seconds Interval Timer to contribute to the translations within the app. Who better to provide accurate translations than the people that know the app the best. 

If you have spotted a translation in the app that you think could be improved, you now have the opportunity to do so.
